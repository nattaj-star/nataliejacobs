                "Jacobs sees strange life in the spaces between apparent
                contradictions. To view her work is to find pleasure in the
                paradox––in the familiar alienation of intimacy, the uncertain joy of
                despair, and the lurid, technicolor beauty of a world on the edge of
                collapse. Though Jacobs’ perspective is clearly informed by a
                generational sense of nihilism and irony, it is also undeniably
                hopeful; there is much more than life in the bodies she paints. This
                is perhaps most apparent in her treatment of figures, which ache like
                childhood friends and swell like new lovers, each of them somehow
                exalted by Jacobs even as she damns them (to this earth, to those
                wounds, to these bodies)."
